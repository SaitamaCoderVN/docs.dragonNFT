# Get & Mint for All

### Function Get & Mint for All for Contributors in the Community

**Overview:**
This function requires a url link to the community's Discord server to directly retrieve detailed information about their rank, avatar, name and level in order to Mint for all members in the community. Currently, we are supporting communities with Discord Servers using the mee6 bot.

    - First, you need to make sure to go to the **Admin** page!
