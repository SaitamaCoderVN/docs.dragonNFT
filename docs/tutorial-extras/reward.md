# Reward

### Reward Function for NFT

**Overview:**
This function is divided into 2 types, one type will reward based on CodeContribute and the corresponding Level of community members, the other type will reward based on the wallet address desired by the community manager.
Currently, the platform is developing for Native Token and in the future, it may be applicable to ERC 20 Token and stable coins.
